# BlockchainDemo
A simple, interactive animation which visualizes how a Proof-of-Work blockchain is created.

Since the entire demo is written in QML/Javascript, this qml program can be run with `qmlscene main.qml` -- there is no need to build the C++ application.

See it in action in [this video](demo.avi?raw=true)!
